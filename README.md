# Randomize_Me_Kap'n ~ aka ~ {Rand0m!z3 M3 Kap'N!}
{This project has been created by Zachary T. Williams aka cerberus1015}

- A fully automated anonymizer that randomizes an individual for online anonymity using various tools such as macchanger and different command line programs.

- The main goal is to provide a one click solution to completely giving your computer a brand new identity with as little effort as possible.

- Another goal is to use as many tools as possible that are stock within ubuntu or kali as to lessen the amount of programs that need to be downloaded.

- In order for this program i.e. bash file to work, "RMK" needs to be stored in the "/bin" directory i.e. folder on your computer. This requires admin privileges i.e. "sudo' to move files to your "/bin" directory. I personally added a new "/bin" directory to my home folder and called that from my bash config files so I can access this program from terminal i.e. command line wherever im at on my computer.

- In order to set up your own "/bin" directory anywhere on your computer, you should follow these instructions as stated by user: souravc. 

{ Just create a folder ~/bin. Add the following line in your ~/.bashrc,

  export PATH=/home/$USER/bin:$PATH

  Source ~/.bashrc from terminal as,

  . ~/.bashrc

  Put files with execution permission inside ~/bin.
